### Usage ###

First, you would require your own Broken Fantasy-style Spreadsheet, a very cool NRP management system made by thesporewowm, it represents different countries (players) economy around a time period.
Since I am not the Broken Fantasy spreadsheet owner, I would require permission of the community's admins for allowing broader test in the proper gs platform.

# HOWEVER! #

This project could be a good starting point should you wish to integrate discord python API with a full stack react + nodejs project alongside gspread.

# How does it works? #

This project is divided into Client ( React Frontend ) and Server ( Discord Bot, NodeJS API ). 
The react frontend being a simple webpage for logging and year change logic. 
The Discord Bot has the functionality of changing the year and creating new users, this is the only way of creating new users for security and simplicity sake
The API is a simple NodeJS API using Session + Passport in a GraphQL API, a local SQLite3 db will be used for keeping track of users.
